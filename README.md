## Hi there 👋

I am a backend developer focused on developing stable, structured, and easily scalable systems. I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree at Bina Sarana Informatika University. I am experienced in building APIs,
data processing, and database integration, which are the main foundation of an application. I am familiar with modern frameworks such as Laravel, CodeIgniter, ReactJS, Golang, and Python.
In the development process, I prioritize clean logic, process efficiency, and data security. I have experience managing data flow from the backend to the frontend, handling validation, 
and ensuring optimal system performance under various conditions.
